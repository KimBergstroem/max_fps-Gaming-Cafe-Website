## Design ðŸ”´

### Colour Scheme ðŸ”»

![Max_Fps Gaming Cafe Website Colour Palette](assets/images/readme/colour-palette.png)

We wanted to choose colours that reflected the environment of dark and gaming, so we have chosen a variety of grey, red and white for our site.

These colors are going to be implemented as 60-30-10 rule with the base of the color GunMetal. We want to have a more dark theme on the website.

The colour palette was created using the [Coolors website](https://coolors.co/aeffd8-8affc1-8fdc97-ac8887-9f4a54).


### Typography ðŸ”»

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* "Lato" is used for headings and bigger content on the site. It is a sans serif typeface family.

![LatoBold700](assets/images/readme/LatoBold700.png)

* "Poppins" is used for the body text, paragraphs on the site. It is a geometric, sans serif typeface family. Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color.

![PoppinsRegular400](assets/images/readme/PoppinsRegular400.png)

### Imagery ðŸ”»

All the images displayed in this site was originelly downloaded by the sites below, and modified in Photoshop.

### Wireframes ðŸ”»

![Max_Fps Gaming Cafe Website Overview](assets/images/readme/OverviewPlanningReadme.png)

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop. I used the web application called [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/suu74na/psiivfn/r6B57) for creating the wireframes for website Max_Fps Gaming Cafe.

Click on the links below to see an large seperated image of each page.

## Features ðŸ”´

The website is comprised of seven pages, four of which are accessible from the Navigation menu (home page, about us page, games page & booking page). The last 3 pages are a "sign up", "log in" and "hours & pricing" which is shown in the Navigation menu but cant access or use it. The "sign up " and "log in" pages are available becouse this requires another programming language along with a database which is not included into this project.

* All Pages on the website have:
  * A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site.  To the left of the navigation bar is the two links for "sign up" and "Log in". In the middle of the navigation bar an image of Max_Fps logo.. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, about, games, pricing and booking). When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.
  ![Navigation bar](assets/images/readme/image-navigationbar.png)
  ![Navigation bar](assets/images/readme/image-navhamburger.png)

  * A footer which contains social media icon links to all the plattforms along with other important links as companys policy and regulation. There is also an company logo which takes the user to the contact us page. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable and attract more young audience. The footer is also including the opening hours as this information are crusial for the user experience. Important information are in the footer and everyone knows that. The "Support" section in my footer is not available at this moment. The links are not working. This is only for display purpose only.
  ![Footer bar](assets/images/readme/image-footer.png)

* Future Implementations.
  * Want to implement the "Sign up" "log in" function. Want to have a database were members can create membership and log in to have discounts, promotion and to see their gaming profile. Members should have their own profile, were they can see hours played etc.
  * I want also to develop a more smoother booking system. Where the client/customer can see a map of all seats, computer available in the Gaming Cafe to click and book. Live updating booking system for better performance.

### Accessibility ðŸ”»

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML elemts as, header(), section(), article(), footer(), nav(), details().
* Declare the Language in the beginning of every html page.
* Using descriptive ALT attributes on images and links on the site.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button or not.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

| Navbar | I cant get the company logo to be still visible after my responsive hamburgar takes the navbar. When the mediaquires kicks in and the navbar is displaying as hamburgar meny, my company logo are also inside the hamburgar meny after. I want my company logo to be displayed beside the hamburgar logo, not inside it with the navbar links. | I created another class with name "logo2", gave it a declaration off "diplay: none:" while in the mediaquires the class "logo2" was declared to "display: block" and property "position" with value "absolute". Then the company logo is displayed when my hamburger meny is kicked in and when it isnt, my class "logo" will display the normal company logo as normal. |
| Navbar | "Element div not allowed as child of element label in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)"                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The solution was to put a "span" attribute instead of div and then give the span attribute a declaration of "display: block;"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
